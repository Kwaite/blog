L'humeur post-anniversaire de Nono s'y prête... Les photos sont même déjà  [là](http://kwaite.free.fr/cpg) 

When you're feeling all right

Everything is up-Tight

Try to sing a song that goes

Ding-Ding-A-Dong.

There will be no sorrow

When you sing tomorrow

And you walk along

with your Ding-Ding-Dong.

Dinge-Dong every hour

when you pick a flower

Even when your lover is gone gone gone.

Dinge-Dong listen to it

maybe it's a big hit.

Even when your lover is gone gone gone

Teach In - Ding a Dong - Eurovision 1975
