Ce soir, 'Moulin Rouge', encore pleuré, retenu cette phrase qui me sied à  ravir pour l'hiver

The show must go on

Inside my heart is breaking

My make-up may be flaking

But my smile still stays on.

Cette nuit, The Cardigans, souvenirs de 1996 avec Lovefool, 10 ans et pas une ride:

Dear, I fear we're facing a problem you love me no longer

I know and maybe there is nothing that I can do to make you do

Mama tells me I shouldn't bother that I ought to stick to another man a man that surely deserves me

but I think you do! So I cry, and I pray and I beg

Love me love me say that you love me

fool me fool me go on and fool me love me love me pretend that you love me

leave me leave me just say that you need me
